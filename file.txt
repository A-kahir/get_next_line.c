Text messaging, or simply texting, is the act of composing and sending electronic messages, typically consisting of alphabetic and numeric characters
between two or more users of mobile phones
tablet computers, smartwatches, desktops/laptops, or another type of compatible computer.
Text messages may be sent over a cellular network or may also be sent via satellite or Internet connection.
The term originally referred to messages sent using the Short Message Service (SMS) on mobile devices.
It has grown beyond alphanumeric text to include multimedia messages using the Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) and Rich Communication Services (RCS)
which can contain digital images, videos, and sound content, as well as ideograms known as emoji (happy faces, sad faces, and other icons)
and on various instant messaging apps. Text messaging has been an extremely popular medium of communication since the turn of the century and has also influenced changes in society.
Text messages are used for personal, family, business, and social purposes. Governmental and non-governmental organizations use text messaging for communication between colleagues. In the 2010s,
the sending of short informal messages became an accepted part of many cultures, as happened earlier with emailing.[5] This makes texting a quick and easy way to communicate with friends family.
